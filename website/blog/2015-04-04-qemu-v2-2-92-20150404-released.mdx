Version 2.2.92-20150404*-dev is the initial release.

<!-- truncate -->

This is the initial release of the **GNU ARM Eclipse QEMU**. It is mainly a technology preview (most of the supported boards are present, but functionality is limited and only projects created with the generic Cortex-M3 template are supported).

As clearly marked, support for these boards is **experimental.** The boards generally include the right ARM core ID and should reflect the real memory banks, but since currently QEMU supports only Cortex-M3 cores, the boards behave like Cortex-M3 cores, so the emulation is not yet very accurate.

## Changes from QEMU 2.2.92

* **-verbose** added, with multiple levels to increase verbosity; the first level of verbosity is always enabled by the plug-in, to get the feedback required when starting the server backend for the debugging session;
* **-semihosting-cmdline** added, to define the semihosting command line, required when running unit tests;
* build script for macOS, Debian 32-bit/64-bit and Windows 32-bit/64-bit (using MinGW-w64) added; the required libraries are build locally

## Eclipse plug-in

The **GNU ARM Eclipse QEMU** is by design intended to be integrated with the **GNU ARM Eclipse plug-ins**. QEMU behaves like a GDB server, allowing to load the application into processor memory and debug as any real board. (Note: the Eclipse plug-in will be available shortly).

## Known problems

<del>The 64-bit version for Windows has some run-time problems and does not execute properly;</del> it was deleted from the released files section; until a solution will be available, the 32-bit version of QEMU can be used on Windows 64-bit; **fixed in release 2.3.50-201508051820-dev**.
