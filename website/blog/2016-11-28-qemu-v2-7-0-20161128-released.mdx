Version 2.7.0-201611282115 is a new release, adding support for active graphical buttons.

## Changes

As the old version 1.2 of the SDL graphical library was less and less supported, the build procedure was updated to use SDL2.

## New features

- the most compelling new feature is **the addition of active graphical buttons**; the rectangles around the buttons are sensitive, and moving the mouse over them **changes the cursor to a hand**; clicking the buttons is also functional, the **Reset** button triggers a board reset; the user button is also connected to the corresponding GPIO pin, and can be checked by **reading the GPIO pin input** value; it is also possible to configure the EXTI device to **trigger interrupts on GPIO pin changes**;
- ths **STM32** implementation was extended to support the `EXTI` and the `SYSCFG` peripherals; now it is possible to trigger interrupts on GPIO pin changes;
- the debug options were extended with two new trace options, `func` and `mr` (use them after `-d`).

## Known problems

- the graphical buttons are currently available only for the STM32F4DISCOVERY board (the user button is connected to GPIO A0); more boards will be added in future versions;
- Ctrl-C does not interrupt the execution if the `--nographic` option is used.

## How to test the buttons

An Eclipse project that can be used to test the STM32F4DISCOVERY button is available from

[https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-qemu-test-projects/tree/master/f407-disc-birq](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-qemu-test-projects/tree/master/f407-disc-birq)

To use it, clone the [gnuarmeclipse/eclipse-qemu-test-projects](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-qemu-test-projects) git and import the `f407-disc-birq` project. Build and run the application; the four coloured LEDs will lit for a second, then turn off; click the blue button; the LEDs will lit one by one. Click the black button; the board will reset.
