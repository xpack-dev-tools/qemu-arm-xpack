The [xPack QEMU Arm](https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/qemu-arm-xpack/)
is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of
[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org), with several extensions for Arm Cortex-M
devices.

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (x64 and x86),
**macOS** (x64) and **GNU/Linux** (x64 and x86, arm64 and arm).

:::note Raspberry Pi

The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported).

:::

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Prerequisites

- x86/x64 GNU/Linux: any system with **GLIBC 2.15** or higher
  (like Ubuntu 12 or later, Debian 8 or later, RedHat/CentOS 7 later,
  Fedora 20 or later, etc)
- arm64/arm GNU/Linux: any system with **GLIBC 2.23** or higher
  (like Ubuntu 16 or later, Debian 9 or later, RedHat/CentOS 8 or later,
  Fedora 24 or later, etc)
- x86/x64 Windows: Windows 7 with the Universal C Runtime
  ([UCRT](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows-c0514201-7fe6-95a3-b0a5-287930f3560c)),
  Windows 8, Windows 10
- x64 macOS: 10.13 or later

On GNU/Linux, QEMU requires the X11 libraries to be present. On Debian derived
distribution they are already in the system; on RedHat & Arch derived
distributions they must be installed explicitly.

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/qemu-arm@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

Comprehensive instructions for installing **xPack QEMU Arm** on different platforms
can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The xPack QEMU Arm currently is based on the official [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org),
with major changes.

The current version is based on:

- QEMU version 2.8.0, commit [0737f32](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/qemu/commit/0737f32daf35f3730ed2461ddfaaf034c2ec7ff0) from Dec 20th, 2016.

## Changes

Compared to the master `qemu-system-arm`, the changes are major, all
application class Arm
devices were removed and replaced by several Cortex-M devices.

The supported boards are:

```console
xPack 64-bit QEMU v2.8.0 (qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse).

Supported boards:

```

Warning: support for hardware floating point on Cortex-M4 devices is not
available yet.

## Bug fixes

- [[#15](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/qemu/issues/15)] -
in certain conditions, with some linker script memory configurations,
the emulator failed complaining that the flash regions overlap; the
problem was fixed on in v2.11 and the two related patches were cherry
picked and adapted to this distribution.

## Enhancements

- none

## Known problems

- Ctrl-C does not interrupt the execution if the `--nographic` option is used.

## Documentation

The original documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/qemu-arm-xpack/blob/xpack/README-MAINTAINER.md) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/qemu-arm-xpack/actions/)
- [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/qemu-arm-xpack/builds/)

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 11 Pro, Ubuntu 22
LTS (x64) and macOS 14.5.

The tests consist in running a simple blinky application
on the graphically emulated STM32F4DISCOVERY board. The binaries were
those generated by the
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/tree/xpack/tests/eclipse)
available in the **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC** project. Use the
`arm-f4b-fs-debug-qemu` debug luncher available in the `arm-f4b-fs` project.

On platforms where Eclipse is not available, the binaries were
tested by manually starting the
blinky test on the emulated STM32F4DISCOVERY board.

```

On Raspberry Pi OS 10 (buster) 64-bit the program was able to run in non
graphic mode, but did not start in graphic mode due to a
missing driver. To be further investigated.

## Deprecation notices

### 32-bit support

Support for 32-bit x86 GNU/Linux and x86 Windows will most probably
be dropped in 2022. Support for 32-bit Arm GNU/Linux will be preserved
for a while, due to the large user base of 32-bit Raspberry Pi systems.

### GNU/Linux minimum requirements

Support for RedHat 7 will most probably be dropped in 2022, and the
minimum requirement will be raised to GLIBC 2.27, available starting
with Ubuntu 18 and RedHat 8.
