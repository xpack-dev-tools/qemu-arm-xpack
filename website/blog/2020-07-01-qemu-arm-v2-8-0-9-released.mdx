Version **2.8.0-9** is a maintenance release; it **adds support for running on Arm platforms**, like **Raspberry Pi**.

<!-- truncate -->

<PageMetadata title={frontMatter.seo_title} />

This is the **xPack** distribution of **QEMU** for Arm Cortex-M
devices  (formerly part of the GNU MCU Eclipse project).

There are separate binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and
**GNU/Linux**, 32/64-bit.

Starting with this version, support for 32/64-bit **Arm GNU/Linux** platforms,
like **Raspberry Pi**, was added.

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/qemu-arm@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

Comprehensive instructions for installing **xPack QEMU Arm** on different platforms
can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

xPack QEMU Arm currently is based on the official [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org),
with major changes.

The current version is based on:

- QEMU version 2.8.0, commit [0737f32](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/qemu/commit/0737f32daf35f3730ed2461ddfaaf034c2ec7ff0) from Dec 20th, 2016.

## Changes

Compared to the master `qemu-system-arm`, the changes are major, all
application class Arm
devices were removed and replaced by several Cortex-M devices.

The supported boards are:

```console
xPack 64-bit QEMU v2.8.0 (qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse).

Supported boards:
  Maple                LeafLab Arduino-style STM32 microcontroller board (r5)
  NUCLEO-F103RB        ST Nucleo Development Board for STM32 F1 series
  NUCLEO-F411RE        ST Nucleo Development Board for STM32 F4 series

  STM32F4-Discovery    ST Discovery kit for STM32F407/417 lines
  STM32F429I-Discovery ST Discovery kit for STM32F429/439 lines
  generic              Generic Cortex-M board; use -mcu to define the device

Supported MCUs:
  STM32F051R8
  STM32F103RB
  STM32F107VC
  STM32F405RG
  STM32F407VG
  STM32F407ZG
  STM32F411RE
  STM32F429ZI
```

Warning: support for hardware floating point on Cortex-M4 devices is not
available yet.

## Known problems

- Ctrl-C does not interrupt the execution if the `--nographic` option is used.

## Documentation

The original documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

- x86/x64 GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- arm64/arm GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 16 Docker container
- x86/x64 Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- x64 macOS: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in a separate
  folder on macOS 10.10.5.

## Build

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/qemu-arm-xpack/blob/xpack/README-MAINTAINER.md) page.

## Travis tests

The first set of tests were performed on Travis, by running
a simple script to check if the binaries start on a wide range of
platforms and distributions:

- [test xPack QEMU Arm on stable platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/qemu-arm-xpack/builds/703891677)
- [test xPack QEMU Arm on latest platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/qemu-arm-xpack/builds/703897230)

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit, Ubuntu 18 LTS 64-bit,
Xubuntu 18 LTS 32-bit and macOS 10.14.

The tests consist in running a simple blinky application
on the graphically emulated STM32F4DISCOVERY board. The binaries were
those generated by the
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/tree/xpack/tests/eclipse)
available in the **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC** project. Use the
`arm-f4b-fs-debug-qemu` debug luncher available in the `arm-f4b-fs` project.

On Arm platforms, where Eclipse is not yet available, the binaries were
tested on Raspberry Pi OS 10 (buster) 32-bit by manually starting the
blinky test on the emulated STM32F4DISCOVERY board.

```console
~/opt/xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/qemu-arm/2.8.0-9.1/.content/bin/qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse --version

mkdir -p ~/Downloads
(cd ~/Downloads; curl -L --fail -o f407-disc-blink-tutorial.elf \
https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/qemu-eclipse-test-projects/raw/master/f407-disc-blink-tutorial/Debug/f407-disc-blink-tutorial.elf)

~/opt/xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/qemu-arm/2.8.0-9.1/.content/bin/qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse \
--board STM32F4-Discovery \
-d unimp,guest_errors \
--nographic \
--image ~/Downloads/f407-disc-blink-tutorial.elf \
--semihosting-config enable=on,target=native \
--semihosting-cmdline test 6

DISPLAY=:1.0 ~/opt/xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/qemu-arm/2.8.0-9.1/.content/bin/qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse \
--board STM32F4-Discovery \
-d unimp,guest_errors \
--image ~/Downloads/f407-disc-blink-tutorial.elf \
--semihosting-config enable=on,target=native \
--semihosting-cmdline test 6
```

On Raspberry Pi OS 10 (buster) 64-bit the program was able to run in non
graphic mode, but did not start in graphic mode due to a
missing driver. To be further investigated.
