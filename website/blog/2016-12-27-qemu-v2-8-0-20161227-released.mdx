Version 2.8.0-201612271623 is a new release, adding support for active graphical buttons to all supported boards.

## Changes

The main internal change is the use of CMSIS SVD files to generate the peripheral registers. This ensures the best possible accuracy in the register bit-fields implementation.

## New features

- the most compelling new feature is **the addition of active graphical buttons**; the rectangles around the buttons are sensitive, and moving the mouse over them **changes the cursor to a hand**; clicking the buttons is also functional, the **Reset** button triggers a board reset; the user button is also connected to the corresponding GPIO pin, and can be checked by **reading the GPIO pin input** value; it is also possible to configure the EXTI device to **trigger interrupts on GPIO pin changes**;
- the **STM32** implementation was extended to support the `EXTI` and the `SYSCFG` or `AFIO` peripherals; now it is possible to trigger interrupts on GPIO pin changes;
- the **STM32F0DISCOVERY** board was added, as a Cortex-M0 board.

## Addressed bugs

- [[#31](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/qemu/issues/31)] - the GPIO toggling using the ODR register is now functional;
- [[#24](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/qemu/issues/24)] - command line options located after `--semihosting-cmdline` are no longer parsed, but passed to the application.

## Known problems

- Ctrl-C does not interrupt the execution if the `--nographic` option is used.

## How to test the buttons

An Eclipse project that can be used to test the STM32F4DISCOVERY button is available from

[https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-qemu-test-projects/tree/master/f407-disc-blink](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-qemu-test-projects/tree/master/f407-disc-blink)

To use it, clone the [gnuarmeclipse/eclipse-qemu-test-projects](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/eclipse-qemu-test-projects) git and import the `f407-disc-blink` project. Build and run the application; the four coloured LEDs will lit for a second, then turn off; click the blue button; the LEDs will lit one by one. Click the black button; the board will reset.
