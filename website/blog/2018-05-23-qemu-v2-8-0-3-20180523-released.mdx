## Changes

No functional changes since the previous release.

This release basically prepares the ground for a new major release, planned to update to the latest QEMU sources.

## Known problems

- Ctrl-C does not interrupt the execution if the `--nographic` option is used.

## Binaries

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

## Build notes

The GNU/Linux binaries were built on two CentOS 6 Docker images (32/64-bit),
and run on any distribution based on CentOS 6 or later.

The Windows binaries were built with mingw-w64, and run on any reasonably
recent **i686** and **x86_64** Windows machines.

## Easy install

QEMU is also available as an
[xPack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gnu-mcu-eclipse/qemu) and can be
conveniently installed with [`xpm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm):

```sh
xpm install --global @gnu-mcu-eclipse/qemu@2.8.0-3.1
```

To install the latest version available, use:

```sh
xpm install --global @gnu-mcu-eclipse/qemu
```

:::note

The method to select the path based on the xPack version was already added to the Eclipse plug-in, but for now is only available in the version published on the test site (https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.netlify.com/v4-neon-updates-test/).

## Manual install

Instructions on how to install the binaries are available in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).
